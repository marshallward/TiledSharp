TiledSharp
==========
A .NET C# library for importing Tiled TMX tile maps

About TiledSharp
----------------
TiledSharp is a .NET C# library for importing TMX tilemaps and TSX tilesets
generated by [Tiled][], a tile map generation tool. The data is saved as a [Map
object](https://github.com/marshallward/TiledSharp/wiki/Tiled-Map-Class), whose
structure closely resembles the original TMX file, and is organized using
standard .NET C#4 structures and objects.

As a generic TMX and TSX parser, TiledSharp does not use any XNA Game Studio
libraries. However, it can be used as an interface to XNA game and library
development.

Usage
-----
To import a TMX file into your C# application:

- Include a reference to TiledSharp, either as source or DLL.

- Import the TiledSharp namespace.

    ```csharp
    using TiledSharp;
    ```

- Create a Map object using the constructor.

    ```csharp
    var map = new Map("yourFile.tmx");
    ```
   
   TiledSharp supports both resource names and file paths, and should work as
   expected in most situations. For more details, please consult the wiki.

- Access the TMX data as Map fields. Principal classes can be accessed by
  either name or index.

    ```csharp
    var map = new Map("yourFile.tmx");

    var version = map.version;
    var myTileset = map.tileset["myTileset"];
    var myLayer = map.layer[2];
    var hiddenChest = map.objectgroup["Chests"].object["hiddenChest"];
    ```

Map fields generally correspond with the TMX file structure. For a complete
listing, see the [TiledSharp Data Hierarchy][].
    
Although TiledSharp can handle objects with the same name, it is not
recommended. For more information, see the [TiledList][] specification.

Notes
-----
[Tiled][] is an open-source (GPL) tile map editor developed and maintained by
Thorbjørn Lindeijer.

Zlib decompression uses the Zlib implementation of [DotNetZip][] v1.9.1.8.
