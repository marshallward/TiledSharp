TiledSharp
==========
A .NET C# library for importing Tiled TMX tile maps


About TiledSharp
----------------
TiledSharp is a .NET C# library for importing TMX_ tilemaps and TSX tilesets
generated by Tiled_, a tile map generation tool. The data is saved as a TmxMap_
object, whose structure closely resembles the original TMX file.

As a generic TMX and TSX parser, TiledSharp does not render the maps or depend
on any external framework beyond .NET, such as Windows, XNA/MonoGame, Unity, or
PSM. However, it can be used as an interface between TMX data and external
games.


Usage
-----
To import a TMX file into your C# application:

- Include a reference to TiledSharp. You can either incorporare it directory
  into your own project, or you can pre-compile it and include the DLL.

- Import the TiledSharp namespace (optional):

  .. code:: csharp

     using TiledSharp;

- Create a Map object using the constructor:

  .. code:: csharp

     var map = new TmxMap("someMap.tmx");

  TiledSharp supports both resource names and file paths, and should work as
  expected in most situations. For more details, please consult the wiki.

- Access the TMX data using the Map fields. Principal classes can be accessed
  by either name or index:

  .. code:: csharp

     var map = new TmxMap("someMap.tmx");
     var version = map.Version;
     var myTileset = map.Tilesets["myTileset"];
     var myLayer = map.Layers[2];
     var hiddenChest = map.ObjectGroups["Chests"].Objects["hiddenChest"];

Map data fields correspond closely to the TMX file structure. For a complete
listing, see the documentation_.

Although TiledSharp can manage elements with the same name, it is not
recommended. For more information, see the TmxList_ specification.


Notes
-----
TiledSharp parses XML files produced by Tiled_, an open-source (GPL) tile map
editor developed and maintained by Thorbjørn Lindeijer.

Zlib decompression in TiledSharp uses the Zlib implementation of DotNetZip_
v1.9.1.8.
