About TiledSharp
----------------

TiledSharp is a .NET C# library for importing [TMX][] tilemaps and TSX tilesets
generated by [Tiled][], a tile map generation tool. The data is saved as a
[TmxMap][] object, whose structure closely resembles the original TMX file.

As a generic TMX and TSX parser, TiledSharp does not render the maps or depend
on any external framework beyond .NET, such as Windows, XNA/MonoGame, Unity, or
PSM. However, it can be used as an interface between TMX data and external
games.


Usage
-----

To import a TMX file into your C# application:

- Include a reference to TiledSharp. You can either incorporare it directory
  into your own project, or you can pre-compile it and include the DLL.

- Import the TiledSharp namespace (optional):

      using TiledSharp;

- Create a Map object using the constructor:

      var map = new TmxMap("someMap.tmx");

  TiledSharp supports both resource names and file paths, and should work as
  expected in most situations. For more details, please consult the wiki.

- Access the TMX data using the Map fields. Principal classes can be accessed
  by either name or index:

      var map = new TmxMap("someMap.tmx");
      var version = map.Version;
      var myTileset = map.Tilesets["myTileset"];
      var myLayer = map.Layers[2];
      var hiddenChest = map.ObjectGroups["Chests"].Objects["hiddenChest"];

Map data fields correspond closely to the TMX file structure. For a complete
listing, see the [TiledSharp Data Hierarchy][].

Although TiledSharp can manage elements with the same name, it is not
recommended. For more information, see the [TmxList][] specification.


Notes
-----

TiledSharp parses XML files produced by [Tiled][], an open-source (GPL) tile
map editor developed and maintained by Thorbj√∏rn Lindeijer.

Zlib decompression in TiledSharp uses the Zlib implementation of [DotNetZip][]
v1.9.1.8.
